				<h1>PinHammer for Hammer</h1>
				<p>A lightweight Hammer template pack using the advantages of Hammer to help kick off site build projects.</p>
				<h2>No Frameworks</h2>
				<p>Thats right, there are no Frameworks involved in this set of Hammer templates. This is kept simple so that you can use it as a basis for creating your own designs and layouts or quickly add the frameworks you need. We have put in place the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Normalised CSS</li>
					<li>REM font sizing</li>
					<li>Golden ration modular type scale</li>
					<li>ARIA roles</li>
					<li>Basic mixins to help with a responsive design approach - depending on your design change them to suit the page layout for the different screen sizes - break them where your layout needs to break not at common screen sizes.</li>
					<li>Commented link in the code to sources of interest</li>
					<li><a href="<!-- @path page2.html -->">CSS styling page</a> with a range of common html tags to help with styling</li>
				</ul>
